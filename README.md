# README

We are using the mazer bootstrap admin theme: https://github.com/zuramai/mazer. We copied some files from the dist into vendors/assets. The theme css and js replaces bootstrap. JQuery and DataTables libraries are also copied from the theme to ensure version compatibility. The theme has several libraries included so in the future if we want to add a js library we should make sure it is not already in the theme.
